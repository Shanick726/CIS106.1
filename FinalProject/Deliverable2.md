# Deliverable 2
## Resources
* Wordpress to build the website.
* Adobe Xd to help plan how I want my website to look.
* stock image websites 
* w3schools to reference specific codes.
* LAMP stack to host a website
## Software
I am learning about how to use wordpress and LAMP stack I've never used either. I understand wordpress helps you create a website but it need to be hosted by something. That is where lamp stack comes in because is allows you to host. I need to understand how to put them together to complete this project.
## Hardware
The hardware being used to create this project are Virtual box with an ubuntu operating system. Most of the software handling is being done through the terminal.
