    * **Kernel** = the core of the system. Manages the hardware.
    * **Daemons** = background programs that run independent of the user.
    * **Shells** = the interface that accepts user input and translates it so that the kernel can use it.
    * **Graphical Desktop Enviornment** = a collection of software that makes the graphical interface.
  * In linux everything is a file.
    * Device files
    * Dsirectory files
    * Binary files
    * Regular files
  ### Software licensing agreement
  * A license agreement outline the rights a user has to a given software
  * Types of licensing agreements:
 
  Opens source | Closed source | free software 
---------------|---------------|--------------
Software can be distributed for free or a fee. **The source code must be distributed with the software.**| Software can be distributed for free or a fee. **The end user has limited access to the software and the source code is not available.** | Software can be distributed for free or a fee. The user has total control of the software and the source code. The software must comply with the 4 freedoms

* Ubuntu is the user friendly versin of Debian.
### What is GNU/Linux
* Linux is modelled on the Unix operating system.
* Linux what a multitasking , multi-user system
